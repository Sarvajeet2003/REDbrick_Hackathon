**ReFood - Donating Together, Changing Forever**

**Sustainable Food Redistribution Initiative**

**1. Introduction**

**Background:**

In the pursuit of eradicating global hunger by 2030, a critical issue surfaces: food waste

management. Up to 40% of food produced in India is wasted due to various factors,

including irrelevant social events and households.

**Problem Description:**

Our challenge is to create a cutting-edge website that serves as a catalyst to minimize

food waste for sustainable development by ensuring surplus food ﬁnds its way to those

who can beneﬁt from it the most.

**Objectives:**

ReFood aims to connect donors and NGOs seamlessly, enabling surplus food to be

redistributed eﬃciently. The portal also provides an AI-assisted platform which tracks

an approximate expiry date for the food products in NGOs’ stocks and prevents

contamination.

**2. Initiative Overview**

**About ReFood:**

ReFood is a revolutionary website that serves as a bridge between surplus food donors

and dedicated NGOs, and then further to the needy. It emphasizes simplicity, eﬃciency,

and positive impact.

**Mission and Vision:**

● Our mission is to eliminate food waste and hunger through eﬃcient

redistribution.

● Our vision is a world where no surplus food gets wasted when it is the need of

millions.

**Core Principles:**

● Seamless Connection: Effortlessly linking donors and NGOs.

● Use of Modern Predictive Technology: Usage of Machine Learning Algorithms for

food contamination prevention.

● Data Integrity: Safeguard donor, NGO, and recipient data.

**3. Initiative Features**

**Donor and NGO Registration:**

Effortless sign-up for both donors and NGOs, to track past records, fostering

engagement.

**Location-Based Matching:**



<a name="br3"></a> 

Location based tracking of the nearest NGOs to soothe the working of both donor and

the NGO.

**Incentive System:**

Encourage consistent donations through rewards such as cash coupons and

merchandise.

**AI-Assisted Stock Management:**

A feed forward neural network model is used to assist the NGOs in managing their food

stocks. The model uses the parameters like food type (fruit/vegetable), cuisine (north

indian/south indian), storage conditions(room temperature, refrigerated) and so on to

keep a predicted shelf life of the food products. As soon as the contamination time

comes closer, the NGO are reminded repeatedly to distribute the food to prevent

contamination.

**4. Use Cases**

**Donor's Journey:**

● Register or log in as a donor.

● Enter surplus food details (quantity, type).

● Choose from nearby NGOs.

● Notiﬁcation sent to selected NGO.

● Upon approval, donation is conﬁrmed.

**NGO's Journey:**

● Register or log in as an NGO.

● Receive notiﬁcation from donors.

● Review and approve donations.

● Timely reminders for distribution.

● Eﬃciently manage surplus stocks.
